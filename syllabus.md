# Course summary
Computers have become essential tools for the advancement of physics. What are their limitations, and how can we use them most effectively? We will survey these topics in PHYS 177. Some potential focus areas include:
- precision and propagation of errors  
- numerical integration methods  
- Monte Carlo simulation  
- data analysis and visualization  
- machine learning and optimization  


We will use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) to introduce methods and assignments, along with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The syllabus, course web page, and assignments will all be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).


# Grading and assessment
Credit will be assigned as follows:
- homework (40%)  
- in-class work and participation (20%)
- midterm exam (15%)  
- final exam (25%)  

I encourage you to freely collaborate with other students on homework and projects.
