Information for the course, including homework assignments and information about exams, will be posted here as we progress through the quarter.

## Lectures

**Lecture 0** -- We began with a brief introduction to Physics 177. Computational methods are used across all physics disciplines. During this quarter, we'll consider a broad cross-sectional overview of numerical methods.

**Lecture 1** -- We started to become familiar with the computational and organizational tools we'll be using this quarter: Python, Jupyter, and GitHub.
